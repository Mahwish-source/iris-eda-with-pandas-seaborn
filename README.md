# iris-eda-with-pandas-seaborn
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the Iris dataset using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. Includes basic data inspection, summary statistics, and visualizations such as scatter plots, histograms, and box plots.
# Task Objective
# The objective of this task is to explore the Iris dataset and practice core data analysis skills.
# Specifically, we aim to learn how to load the dataset, inspect its structure, and use basic
# visualizations to understand feature relationships, distributions, and potential outliers.

# Your Approach
# We load the Iris dataset using pandas, then examine its shape, column names, and first few rows
# using .shape, .columns, and .head(). Next, we compute summary statistics to understand the
# numeric features. For visualization, we use matplotlib and seaborn to create scatter plots,
# histograms, and box plots to analyze relationships and distributions.

# Results and Insights
# From the visualizations, we observe clear patterns between petal measurements and species,
# with some classes being more easily separable. Histograms show how each feature is distributed,
# while box plots highlight the spread of values and any potential outliers. Overall, the Iris
# dataset provides a simple but powerful example for understanding basic EDA techniques.
